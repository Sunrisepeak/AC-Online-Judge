## Instructions
> Each folder is a question bank. it is in order easy view about accept code and its thinking that to insert some analyze content by `Markdown` in source file. Therefore, it would renamed for " `number.cpp.md` ", but this havan't influence part of code because of `Markdown` is annotation by " `/**/` ". So if you want to compiler it that only need remove " `.md` " in file end.
>+ You can try to try following way:
>    + click a *.cpp.md file([Example](PTA/PAT(Basic-level)/1002.cpp.md)) to read content of code and analyze
>    + complier source file for Linux
>>  	  mv filename.cpp.md filename.cpp;
>> 		  g++ -Wall -std=c++11 filename.cpp;
>>		  ./a.out
